This is a posterity project.  As with all of my posterity projects, t was built for a previous (open source) employer.  I was given permission by my supervisor to post this for portfolio and learning purposes.  If you represent the employer in question and the stance has changed, please contact me to have this taken down!

Because of its posterity status, parts of the code have been redacted - sometimes heavily.  It is very unlikely this will run out of the box.

This project was for an automated disk-testing station. It is a simple set of scripts run off the CLI (bash) of a Cent7 install.  It is built on python and uses curses as a frontend.  It also requires the pySMART-0.31 library to run.

This project is definitely a hard-coded piece of software for a specific task - not a general redistributable.
